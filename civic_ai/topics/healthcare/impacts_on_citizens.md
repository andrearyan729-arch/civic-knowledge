## **I. Introduction: When Policy Hits Home**

Healthcare decisions made in Washington or state capitals determine whether families can afford to see a doctor, fill prescriptions, or keep their hospitals open.  

What may sound like a “budget adjustment” on paper becomes a life-altering event when coverage disappears, bills double, or local hospitals close.  
The 2025 Budget Reconciliation law is one of those turning points — a policy that shifts costs from government to households, and from the healthy to the sick.

## **II. Coverage Losses and Who Is Most Affected**

When federal support for ACA subsidies and Medicaid is reduced, coverage gaps widen fastest among people with the least flexibility.  
The **Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF)** estimates that **more than 10 million people nationwide** could lose or forfeit health insurance under the 2025 law.

**Most affected groups:**
- **Low- and middle-income families** who rely on ACA Marketplace subsidies.  
- **Children and working parents** in Medicaid and CHIP programs.  
- **Seniors and disabled individuals** facing higher Medicare out-of-pocket costs.  
- **Rural residents** in states that never expanded Medicaid.  

Each percentage point increase in the uninsured rate equals roughly **3 million people** losing coverage — with cascading effects on hospitals, local economies, and public health.

## **III. Financial Fallout: Medical Debt and Cost Burden**

Even before these cuts, nearly **4 in 10 American adults** carried medical debt — the **leading cause of personal bankruptcy** in the United States.  
As subsidies expire and out-of-pocket costs rise, millions will face impossible choices between medical care, rent, and food.

**Key realities:**
- The average American family now spends **over $7,000 annually** on healthcare premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.  
- Roughly **one in four adults** report skipping care due to cost.  
- “Underinsurance” — having coverage but being unable to afford to use it — affects nearly **45%** of working-age adults.  
- Medical debt has become a form of long-term poverty, damaging credit scores and limiting financial recovery.

## **IV. Access to Care: Closures, Shortages, and Wait Times**

Cuts to federal funding have intensified an existing access crisis.  

- Since 2010, more than **150 rural hospitals** have closed nationwide — many in states that refused Medicaid expansion.  
- Urban safety-net hospitals are overwhelmed as uninsured patients turn to emergency rooms for basic care.  
- Staffing shortages, delayed reimbursements, and burnout drive record healthcare worker turnover.  

Every closure forces patients to travel farther, wait longer, and pay more — a slow-motion collapse of the care infrastructure that once held communities together.

## **V. Health Outcomes and Human Cost**

The link between insurance coverage and life expectancy is well-documented.  
When people lose coverage, they delay care, skip preventive screenings, and experience higher mortality rates.

- Uninsured adults are **nearly twice as likely to die prematurely** from treatable conditions.  
- Delayed cancer diagnoses and unmanaged diabetes have risen sharply in areas with coverage losses.  
- The U.S. **maternal mortality rate (32.9 deaths per 100,000 births)** is now more than triple that of peer nations — and rising fastest among women of color.  

Each data point represents real people whose outcomes changed because of deliberate policy decisions.

## **VI. Inequality: Who Suffers the Most**

Healthcare cuts deepen existing inequalities rather than close them.  

- **Racial disparities:** Black and Native mothers face **maternal mortality rates 3–4× higher** than white mothers.  
- **Geographic disparities:** Rural residents are **70% more likely** to lack access to primary care.  
- **Gender disparities:** Women pay more out-of-pocket and are more likely to be underinsured.  
- **State disparities:** People in non-expansion states are nearly **twice as likely** to be uninsured.  

The system’s inequities mirror its priorities — and those priorities are often set by who can afford to influence policy.

## **VII. The Ripple Effect: Economy and Workforce**

Healthcare isn’t just a line item in household budgets — it shapes the labor market itself.

- **Employers** shift rising healthcare costs to workers through higher premiums and deductibles.  
- **Small businesses** struggle to compete with large corporations that self-insure.  
- **Workers** delay retirement or take second jobs just to keep employer coverage.  
- **The economy** loses billions annually in productivity due to untreated chronic conditions.

## **VIII. Public Perception, Trust — and the Why**

Many Americans believe the healthcare system is “rigged” — not because they misunderstand it, but because outcomes reinforce that belief.  
Over decades, lobbying and campaign contributions have steered policy toward corporate profit and away from public good.

**How we got here:**
- **Corporate influence:** The healthcare sector spends **over $700 million annually** on lobbying, more than any other industry.  
- **Tax priorities:** Wealthy individuals and corporations receive tax breaks, while healthcare funding is cut to offset them.  
- **Messaging wars:** Cuts are branded as “deficit control” or “efficiency,” masking who truly benefits.  
- **Disinformation:** Political narratives frame social programs as “wasteful,” eroding public support.  

As citizens lose trust, many disengage — which only strengthens the influence of those writing the rules.

> **Why we’re here:**  
> Because decisions that prioritize shareholders over patients — and donors over voters — have gone largely unchecked.  
> The result is a system that rewards profit extraction while punishing illness and poverty.

## **IX. Summary Takeaway**

> Rising healthcare costs are not just an economic story — they are a reflection of national values.  
> Who benefits, who pays, and who suffers are choices made in budgets, not inevitabilities.  
> Restoring fairness begins with transparency, accountability, and civic participation.
