# Drivers of Rising Healthcare Costs
_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

Healthcare costs rise due to a combination of structural, policy, and market forces.  
Understanding these drivers helps connect national policy choices to what people experience locally.

## Key Drivers
1. **Hospital and clinician labor** – Staffing shortages, wage growth, and overtime pay increase operational costs.
2. **Prescription drug prices** – Limited price negotiation power and patent extensions delay lower-cost generics and biosimilars.
3. **Market consolidation** – Mergers among hospitals, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers reduce competition and raise prices.
4. **Administrative complexity** – Multiple payers and billing systems add overhead to every healthcare dollar spent.
5. **Reimbursement levels** – Shifts in Medicare/Medicaid payment formulas change how much hospitals receive for care.
6. **Technology and site-of-care shifts** – High-cost imaging, robotics, and outpatient migration require expensive infrastructure.
7. **Policy uncertainty** – Short-term renewals and court challenges increase volatility in insurer pricing.
