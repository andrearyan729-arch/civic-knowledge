## 1. Health Insurance Premiums & Rates
- **2025 Rate Filings:** The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) approved an average **12–14% increase** in individual market premiums for 2025.  
- Small group plans rose by **7–9%**, driven by hospital labor costs, specialty drug prices, and post-pandemic care backlogs.  
- DFS reports cite rising inpatient costs and insurer reserve adjustments as major drivers.  
- Enrollment in the **Essential Plan** (state’s low-cost ACA program) remains stable, but overall affordability concerns are growing.

## 2. Hospital Closures & Financial Distress
- As of 2025, at least **11 rural and community hospitals** have announced full or partial closures since 2020, primarily in the North Country, Southern Tier, and Western NY.  
- Facilities in **Erie, St. Lawrence, and Chenango counties** are operating under financial distress designations.  
- Rural hospitals report an average **–4% to –7% margin**, compared to +1% for urban facilities.  
- Loss of obstetric and emergency services has been particularly acute.

**Recent examples:**
- Eastern Niagara Hospital (Lockport) closed in 2023.  
- Wyoming County Community Hospital reduced inpatient services in 2024.  
- St. Lawrence Health System delayed planned expansions due to workforce shortages.

## 3. Emergency Care and Staffing Impacts
- **Emergency room wait times** have lengthened statewide, particularly in Upstate regions with fewer active hospitals.  
- Many facilities report reliance on **travel nurses** at premium rates, increasing operational costs further.  
- Ambulance diversion events and **“boarding” of admitted patients in ERs** are up significantly since 2022.  
- Rural EMS providers face volunteer shortages and increased call volume.

## 4. Medicaid and State Budget Pressures
- The 2025–26 New York State Budget includes **$1.2 billion** in cost-saving adjustments to Medicaid reimbursement rates.  
- Hospitals warn these cuts could worsen access in rural and high-uninsured areas.  
- The state continues to pursue **federal 1115 waiver extensions** for delivery system reform and uncompensated care funding.

## 5. Outlook
While New York’s healthcare system remains among the most robust in the nation, continued financial strain threatens access in lower-income and rural regions.  
Without stable funding and workforce solutions, closures could accelerate, particularly outside New York City.
