# 🏥 The Rising Cost of Healthcare in the U.S.
_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

---

## **Plain-English Overview**
The United States spends more on healthcare than any nation on earth — over **$4.5 trillion annually** (≈ $13,000 per person).  
Premiums and prescription costs keep rising faster than wages while benefits shrink.  
Hospital systems, insurance companies, and drug makers post **record profits** and **record CEO compensation**.  

America is entering a healthcare affordability crisis driven by two converging forces:
1. Long-term cost growth and industry consolidation.  
2. New policy changes that reduce federal support for healthcare programs.

## **The Paradox of American Healthcare: Richest Nation, Worst Results**

The United States spends more on healthcare than any country in the world — but delivers worse outcomes than almost all other wealthy nations.

| Measure | United States | OECD Average | Rank / Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Healthcare Spending (2024)** | **~$4.5 trillion (≈17% of GDP)** | ~9.5% of GDP | **#1 in cost** |
| **Per Capita Spending** | **$13,000+ per person** | $5,500 | Nearly **2.5× higher** |
| **Life Expectancy** | **77 years** | 82 years | **Last among peers** |
| **Infant Mortality (per 1,000 births)** | **5.4** | 3.3 | **Highest among peers** |
| **Maternal Mortality (per 100k births)** | **32.9** | 8–10 | **Triple the peer average** |
| **Out-of-Pocket Costs (Annual)** | **$1,300+ per capita** | ~$650 | **Double the average** |

> 🇺🇸 *The U.S. is the richest nation on earth — but the only one where medical debt is a leading cause of personal bankruptcy.*

**Why this matters:**  
This contradiction reflects deep systemic inefficiencies and policy decisions that prioritize profit over prevention.  
High costs don’t translate to better care — they reflect administrative complexity, market power, and policy choices that burden citizens instead of protecting them.

**Sources:** OECD Health Statistics (2024), Commonwealth Fund, Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).


The result: higher premiums, fewer coverage options, and a widening gap between those who can afford care and those who cannot.

## **How the U.S. Healthcare System Is Funded**

### A. Public Programs
- **Medicare** — federal insurance for seniors and disabled individuals, funded by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.  
- **Medicaid / CHIP** — joint federal–state programs for low-income families and children.  
- **ACA Subsidies** — premium tax credits that make private Marketplace plans more affordable.

### B. Private Sector
Employer-sponsored insurance covers more than half of Americans under 65.  
The individual ACA marketplace serves self-employed, gig-economy, and part-time workers.

### C. Out-of-Pocket Costs
Even with insurance, Americans pay more out-of-pocket than citizens in any other wealthy country.

## **Major Cost Drivers**

1. **Administrative Overhead** – A multi-payer system creates massive billing complexity. 15–25¢ of every healthcare dollar goes to paperwork and overhead.  
2. **Hospital Consolidation** – Mergers give large systems regional monopolies and pricing power.  
3. **Pharmaceutical Pricing** – Brand drugs often cost 2–3× more than in other nations. PBM middlemen profit from hidden rebates.  
4. **Executive Pay & Profit Margins** – Top CEOs earn $15–25 M per year, mostly tied to stock price rather than patient outcomes.  
5. **Technology Inflation** – High-tech procedures and drugs improve care but increase costs far beyond global benchmarks.  
6. **Fee-for-Service Incentives** – Providers are rewarded for volume of procedures, not for keeping people healthy.

## **Recent Federal Policy Shifts**

### Under the Biden Administration (2021–2025)
- Enhanced ACA subsidies lowered premiums for 15 M people.  
- Medicare gained limited **drug price negotiation authority** (Inflation Reduction Act).  
- A **$35 insulin cap** for Medicare beneficiaries.  
- **Surprise billing ban** and **hospital price-transparency rules**.

### Under the Current Administration (2025– )
- Allows enhanced ACA subsidies to **expire 12/31/2025**.  
- **Cuts federal Medicaid/CHIP funding.**  
- Slows enforcement of transparency and drug-cost reforms.  
- Frames reductions as “deficit control,” despite concurrent tax breaks for corporations and energy producers.

---

## **The Legislation Behind the Crisis**

The 2025 Budget Reconciliation law combined healthcare funding cuts with unrelated fiscal provisions.

**Healthcare-related sections**
- Ends enhanced ACA premium credits.  
- Reduces federal Medicaid/CHIP matching rates.  
- Limits Medicare growth through administrative caps.

**Non-health sections**
- Expands fossil-fuel subsidies and corporate tax deductions.  
- Adds upper-income tax benefits.  
- Offsets those costs with healthcare cuts.

The bill claims deficit neutrality but shifts costs onto households and states.

---

## **Supporters’ Rationale vs Critics’ Reality**

**Supporters say:**  
- These cuts control deficits and promote efficiency.  
- States and private markets can manage coverage better.

**Critics respond:**  
- The cuts don’t make care cheaper; they just shift the burden to patients.  
- Simultaneous corporate tax benefits worsen inequality.  
- Hospitals—especially rural—face closures as uncompensated care rises.

---

## **Lobbying & Corporate Influence**

- Healthcare is the **largest lobbying sector** in America, spending over **$700 M per year**.  
- Top executives: UnitedHealth ($23 M in 2024), Cigna ($20 M in 2024).  
- Industry PACs donate across both parties, influencing committee agendas.  
- Lobbying efforts have delayed drug-price negotiations and softened billing reforms.

**Bottom line:** Policy often reflects the interests of those profiting from it.

---

## **Implications for Americans**

- **Premiums:** Expected to rise $200–$400 per month as ACA subsidies expire.  
- **Hospitals:** More closures, especially rural and safety-net facilities.  
- **Medicare:** Beneficiaries may face slower benefit growth and higher cost-sharing.  
- **Economic Gap:** Tax breaks for corporations widen inequality.  
- **Public Health:** Delayed care, higher mortality, and long-term cost increases.

---

## **Citizen Power & Democracy’s Role**

### Why Democracy Matters
Healthcare outcomes are determined by elected officials’ votes.  
Every congressional vote shapes what citizens pay and what coverage they receive.

### Collective Action Works
- Ballot initiatives expanded Medicaid in multiple states.  
- Grassroots advocacy helped pass the insulin cap and surprise-billing reforms.  
- Constituent engagement — calls, letters, and local organizing — drives accountability.

### The Challenge
Disinformation confuses voters about what laws actually do.  
Accurate civic information restores trust and action.

### Key Message
Democracy is the mechanism that determines who gets care and at what cost — and citizens hold the power to change it.

> **democracy itself.**
