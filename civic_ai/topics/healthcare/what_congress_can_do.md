## **I. Introduction: The Role of Congress**

Every aspect of the U.S. healthcare system — what’s covered, what costs, and who pays — ultimately runs through **Congress**.  
It decides how much federal money supports Medicare and Medicaid, how subsidies are distributed, and how tax policy affects both citizens and corporations.  

When healthcare becomes unaffordable, it’s not a natural disaster — it’s a **policy outcome**.  
The laws Congress writes (or fails to write) determine whether people get care or go without.

> 🏥 “Every healthcare crisis in America can be traced to a vote, a rule, or a line of legislation.”

## **II. Congressional Powers That Shape Healthcare**

Congress has **three primary levers** that control how the system functions:

1. **Spending (Appropriations)** — Determines how much money flows to Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and public health agencies.  
2. **Tax Policy** — Defines who gets healthcare subsidies, how employer plans are taxed, and what corporate deductions apply.  
3. **Regulatory Oversight** — Directs how agencies like HHS, CMS, and the FTC enforce transparency, competition, and consumer protections.

> 💬 Every budget, amendment, and committee markup is effectively a healthcare vote — even if it doesn’t have “healthcare” in the title.

## **III. What Congress Has Done Recently**

The *2025 Budget Reconciliation Law* reshaped healthcare by embedding major funding cuts within a larger fiscal package.

### Key Provisions
- **ACA Premium Subsidies Expire:**  
  Roughly 15 million people will see premiums rise as enhanced tax credits end on 12/31/2025.  
- **Medicaid & CHIP Federal Match Reductions:**  
  States lose billions in federal support, forcing budget cuts or coverage rollbacks.  
- **Medicare Spending Caps:**  
  Growth limits constrain administrative budgets and slow benefit expansion.  
- **Corporate & Energy Tax Breaks:**  
  Expanded fossil-fuel incentives and upper-income tax deductions offset healthcare cuts.  
- **Regulatory Rollbacks:**  
  Slower enforcement of hospital price-transparency and drug-pricing reforms.

> **Plain-English Summary:**  
> Congress chose to cut healthcare programs to offset new corporate and tax benefits — effectively raising costs for families while lowering them for the wealthy.

## **IV. Why Congress Votes Against Public Interest**

Many lawmakers know these outcomes — yet vote for them anyway.  
This isn’t about one party or another; it’s about **how power and incentives are structured.**

### A. Campaign Finance and Lobbying
- Healthcare is America’s **#1 lobbying industry**, spending over **$700 million annually** — more than defense and energy combined.  
- Industry PACs target influential committee members who control healthcare budgets.  
- Former lawmakers and staff often move directly into lobbying or consulting roles in the same sectors they once regulated.

> 💵 Policy doesn’t just follow public need — it follows campaign contributions.

### B. Gerrymandering and Safe Seats
- In “safe” districts, lawmakers fear **donors and primaries** more than general elections.  
- That means they can vote against constituent needs with little political consequence.

### C. Narrative Engineering
- Misinformation reframes cuts as “freedom from government” or “spending control.”  
- Talking points are often tested and distributed by lobby groups, not policy analysts.  
- This confusion prevents voters from understanding how laws affect them personally.

### D. Short-Term Politics Over Long-Term Policy
- Lawmakers seek immediate messaging wins — not multi-year reforms.  
- Real cost control requires cooperation, but polarization rewards obstruction.

> 🧩 Congress isn’t dysfunctional by accident — it’s operating exactly as its incentive system encourages.

## **V. The Cost of Inaction**

- **Uninsured Americans:** Rising again for the first time in a decade.  
- **Rural Hospitals:** Dozens closing due to loss of Medicaid reimbursements.  
- **Families:** Premiums up $200–$400/month for Marketplace plans.  
- **Seniors:** Medicare growth caps mean fewer updates and higher out-of-pocket costs.  
- **Economy:** Healthcare inflation remains double overall inflation, suppressing wages.

Inaction doesn’t stabilize the system — it just lets private costs spiral while public funding shrinks.

## **VI. What Congress *Can* Do Right Now**

### A. Restore and Expand Federal Support
- **Reinstate Enhanced ACA Subsidies:**  
  Make them permanent to stabilize premiums.  
- **Reverse Medicaid and CHIP Cuts:**  
  Raise federal match rates and simplify enrollment.  
- **Fully Fund Community Health Centers:**  
  Prevent rural closures and expand preventive care access.  
- **Modernize CHIP:**  
  CHIP — the *Children’s Health Insurance Program* — is a joint federal-state plan covering kids whose families earn too much for Medicaid but too little for private insurance.  
  It serves **~7 million children** nationwide.  
  Congress can strengthen CHIP by:
  - Guaranteeing continuous 12-month eligibility for all children.  
  - Expanding coverage to pregnant women and postpartum care.  
  - Increasing automatic enrollment through schools and tax filings.  

> 👶 CHIP is one of the most cost-effective programs in government — it delivers enormous health and economic returns per dollar spent.

### B. Strengthen Oversight and Transparency
- Enforce **hospital and insurer price-posting laws**.  
- Fund **antitrust investigations** into hospital and PBM monopolies.  
- Expand **FTC and DOJ authority** to block anti-competitive healthcare mergers.

---

### C. Rein in Pharmaceutical and PBM Power
- Expand Medicare’s **drug price negotiation** to all categories.  
- End **rebate secrecy** and require transparent PBM reporting.  
- Incentivize **generic and biosimilar competition** through patent reform.  
- Penalize “evergreening” tactics that delay affordable alternatives.

---

### D. Reform Campaign Finance and Lobbying
- Restrict **industry PAC donations** to members of healthcare-related committees.  
- Require **real-time public disclosure** of lobbying expenditures.  
- Enforce **cooling-off periods** to prevent lawmakers from lobbying immediately after leaving office.  
- Create an **independent ethics panel** to monitor industry influence.

---

### E. Empower States and Citizens
- Allow **state innovation waivers** for public-option or hybrid systems.  
- Provide **federal grants** to states that meet health-equity and transparency benchmarks.  
- Fund **civic education programs** that explain how healthcare laws actually work.  
- Require **constituent communication dashboards** showing how many voters contacted each office about key healthcare bills.

## **VII. Oversight Committees That Matter**

## **IX. Summary Takeaway**

> Congress has the power to make healthcare affordable — and the power to keep it unaffordable.  
> The system reflects deliberate policy choices: who to tax, who to subsidize, and who to protect.  
> Understanding those choices — and who makes them — is the first step toward changing them.
