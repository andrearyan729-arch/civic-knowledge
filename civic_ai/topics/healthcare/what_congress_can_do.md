# What Congress Can Do About Healthcare Costs
_Last updated: 2025-10-08_

Congress has the constitutional power to shape national healthcare spending, insurance coverage rules, and reimbursement systems.  
This section outlines the levers lawmakers can use â€” and how those decisions reach your local hospital or insurance bill.

## 1. Control of the Purse
- Congress funds public health programs through annual appropriations bills.  
- These bills determine how much goes to Medicare, Medicaid, community health centers, and rural hospital support.  
- Changes in these allocations can immediately affect local access and staffing.

## 2. Legislative Authority
- Congress can pass laws adjusting payment rates for Medicare and Medicaid.  
- It can regulate or incentivize transparency in pricing and billing.  
- Oversight hearings and committee reports influence how agencies implement these laws.

## 3. Competition & Consumer Protection
- Strengthening antitrust enforcement can reduce hospital and insurer monopolies.  
- Laws can require public reporting of negotiated rates between hospitals and insurers.  
- Congress can expand subsidies or cost-sharing reductions under the ACA.

## 4. The Separation of Powers Connection
- **Executive Branch:** implements and enforces healthcare laws through HHS, CMS, and related agencies.  
- **Congress:** writes and funds these programs.  
- **Judicial Branch:** interprets challenges and constitutional questions.

### Why it matters
Understanding congressional influence helps citizens know **who to contact** and **what issues to raise** when healthcare becomes unaffordable or inaccessible.
